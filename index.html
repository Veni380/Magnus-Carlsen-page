        <h3>Here's a time line of Carlsen's achievements as a chess player:</h3>
        <ul id='timeline'>
          <li><b>2004</b> - In the sixth Dubai Open Chess Championship, held 18–28 April, Carlsen obtained his third and final <abbr title='Grandmaster'>GM</abbr> norm at the age of 13, becoming the youngest <abbr title='Grandmaster'>GM</abbr> at the time and the second youngest in history after Sergey Karjakin. Today standing at 8th.</li>
          <li><b>2005</b> - Defeats Alexei Shirov, ranked 10. in the world at the time, in the Smartfish Chess Masters tournament and ends up at second place.</li>
          <li><b>2008</b> - Won the annual Aerosvit chess tournament finishing undefeated with 8/11 in a category 19 field and achieving a <abbr title='performance rating'>PR</abbr> of 2877, his best <abbr title='performance rating'>PR</abbr> at that point in his career. - Finished second in the Mainz World Rapid Chess Championship, only losing to the defending champion Viswanathan Anand.</li>
          <li><b>2009</b> - Won the category 21 Nanjing Pearl Spring tournament, 2½ points ahead of second-place finisher Topalov, the world's highest-rated player at the time. He scored an undefeated 8/10, winning every game as white (against Topalov, Wang Yue, Leko, Teimour Radjabov, and Dmitry Jakovenko), and also winning as black against Jakovenko. By rating performance, this was one of the greatest results in history, with a PR of 3002. Chess statistician Jeff Sonas has declared it one of the 20 best tournament performances of all time, and the best chess performance of all time by a teenager. - At the end of the year he became the youngest ever player to break the 2800 rating barrier in classical chess.</li>
          <li><b>2012</b> - Goes undefeated with 5 wins and 3 draws to win the London Chess Classic in December. This win increased his rating from 2848 to the new highest rating ever of 2861, breaking Kasparov's 13-year record of 2851.</li>
          <li><b>2013</b> - Beats Anand in the World Championship with 3 wins and 7 draws, making him the 16th undisputed World Chess Champion.</li>
          <li><b>2014</b> - Emerges victorious in the World Championship rematch with Anand by scoring 3 wins, one loss and 7 draws, setting him on a 2 win streak.</li>
          <li><b>2015</b> - In October, Carlsen successfully defended his title in the FIDE World Rapid Championships held in Berlin, as the first World Rapid Champion to do so in history. He reached the highest live rapid rating in history after the tournament, and was at that point ranked No. 1 in all three disciplines(Classical, Rapid, Blitz) simultaneously.</li>
          <li><b>2016</b> - After 7 draws Carlsen loses a game in the Wolrd Championship against Sergey Karjakin. Then miraculously pulls back a win with white after another draw and the players make draws for the rest of the classical games, tying at 6-6. In the rapid tiebreaker, consisting of 4 rapid games, the first 2 games were drawn but Carlsen wins the final 2 making this his third consecutive World Championship win. This was the closest he has ever been to losing a World Championship in his career.</li>
          <li><b>2018</b> - At the World Championship against Fabiano Caruana all 12 classical games end in draws but Carlsen beats Caruana 3-0 in the rapid tiebreaks. Players making this many draws shock the chess world and the following World Championships would now have 14 classical games instead of 12. This also put Carlsen on a streak of 4 World Championship victories.</li>
          <li><b>2019</b> - At the FIDE Grand Swiss Tournament 2019 held in October on the Isle of Man, Carlsen placed sixth with 7½/11. He thus extended his unbeaten streak in classical chess to 101 games, surpassing Ding's record of 100 games. The 101 games consisted of 33 wins and 68 draws.</li>
          <li><b>2020</b> - During the 8th Norway Chess event, Carlsen's unbeaten streak in classical chess was ended by Jan-Krzysztof Duda. He had gone 125 games without defeat, a period spanning 2 years, 2 months and 10 days.</li>
          <li><b>2021</b> - At the 2021 World Chess Championship, Carlsen defeated challenger Ian Nepomniachtchi in Game 6 after drawing the first five games. It was the first decisive result in a World Chess Championship game in more than 5 years and at 136 moves was also the longest game in World Chess Championship history. Subsequently, Carlsen also defeated Nepomniachtchi in Games 8, 9, and 11, thus retaining his championship title once again.</li>
          <li><b>2022</b> - Next World Championship will be happening soon.</li>
